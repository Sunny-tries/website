      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a passionate data analyst with a strong desire to prove myself and continuously learn. 
        I excel both as part of a team and working independently, always committed to delivering results. 
        My technical skillset includes proficiency in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, allowing me to uncover insights 
        and drive data-informed decisions. Whether it’s streamlining processes or building effective dashboards, 
        I take pride in my ability to solve problems and adapt to new challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I love gaming, spending time with my cat, going to the gym, and enjoying memes. 
        I value quality time with family and friends and believe in bringing positive energy to any team I join. 
        My hobbies help me build focus, creativity, and adaptability—qualities I bring into my work. 
        I thrive in dynamic environments and aim to contribute not just with my skills, but also with a positive attitude 
        and collaborative spirit.
